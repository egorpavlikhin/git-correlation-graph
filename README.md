## Features

- Load and visualize JSON files containing git correlation graph data
- Interactive graph visualization with force-directed layout
- Filter nodes by minimum commit count and maximum connections
- View statistics about the loaded graph
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the GitCorrelationGraphUI directory
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Using the batch file (Windows)

Simply double-click the `start.bat` file in the GitCorrelationGraphUI directory.

#### Option 2: Using the command line

Navigate to the GitCorrelationGraphUI directory and run:

```bash
# On Windows
start.bat

# On macOS/Linux
./start.js
```

This will start the application and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

#### For developers

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

1. First, generate a correlation graph JSON file using the GitCorrelationGraph tool
2. Start the GitCorrelationGraphUI application
3. Click "Select JSON File" and choose the generated JSON file
4. The graph will be loaded and displayed
5. Use the filter controls to adjust the visualization:
   - Minimum Commit Count: Hide files with fewer commits than this value
   - Maximum Connections: Hide files with more connections than this value
6. Explore the graph:
   - Hover over nodes to see file names and commit counts
   - Hover over edges to see correlation percentages
   - Drag nodes to rearrange the graph
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Drag the background to pan
